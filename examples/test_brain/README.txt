# 🧪 Test Brain: Solar Energy Knowledge Graph

This is a minimal "Toy Dataset" created to demonstrate the agnostic capabilities of GraphRAG Core.

## Contents
1. **test_skeleton.json**: A small graph with 3 nodes (Solar Energy, Carbon Reduction, Grid Stability) and 2 edges.
2. **test_db/**: A ChromaDB vector database containing indexed abstracts about these topics.

## Purpose
Use this dataset to verify that the engine can switch contexts from Climate Adaptation to Energy Engineering instantly.
